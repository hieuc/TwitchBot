[2019-07-20 23:37:22] metanacho: Hi Scarra, this is Morde’s mom. I noticed you haven’t been picking my son for your team in gym class. Morde has been having a really tough time since his dad and. I split up, and it doesn’t make it easy on him when you reroll and say, „We’re never taking Morde.“ I think you should take a hard look at yourself in the mirror and think how it would feel if someone said that about you. Morde has phantom synergy, knight synergy, and he can hit 2 units! Why don’t you try being a bit more inclusive??!
